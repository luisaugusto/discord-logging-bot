# Discord Logging Bot

This is a deprecated bot that I used to test different features of the Discord API. Features are currently be migrated to other bots within my organization [Discord Botique](https://github.com/Discord-Botique) to be made scalable.

## Features
### To Be Deprecated
- Plays music in a voice channel (currently broken)
- Generate an image with AI
- Summarize a channel with `/summarize`
- Translates a message using flag emojis
- Talk to AI Bot

### To Be Migrated
#### Logging bot
- Logs when messages are deleted
- Logs when a user joins and leaves a voice channel

#### [Announcements Bot](https://github.com/Discord-Botique/Announcements)
- Welcomes a user when they join the server
- Sends a message when someone boosts the server

#### Moderation Bot
- Can moderate messages with AI
- Report a message with context window
